# Spec-Kit Integration Guide

> **Integration Guide:** Using [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) with AI Bootstrap documentation

This guide explains how to use Spec-Kit commands (`/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`) with the comprehensive documentation generated by AI Bootstrap.

---

## Overview

**Spec-Kit** is a toolkit for Spec-Driven Development that helps you build features through structured workflows:

1. **Constitution** - Define project principles and rules
2. **Specify** - Define WHAT and WHY (feature specification)
3. **Plan** - Define HOW (technical implementation plan)
4. **Tasks** - Break down plan into actionable tasks
5. **Implement** - Execute implementation tasks

**AI Bootstrap** generates comprehensive documentation that provides the context needed for each Spec-Kit command. This guide maps which AI Bootstrap documents to reference for each Spec-Kit command.

---

## Spec-Kit Workflow

```
/speckit.constitution → /speckit.specify → /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks → /speckit.implement
```

**Order matters:** Each command builds on the previous one, so execute them sequentially.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with Constitution

Before using any Spec-Kit command, ensure `memory/constitution.md` exists and reflects your project's principles. This document guides all subsequent decisions.

### 2. Reference Documents in Order

When using a Spec-Kit command, reference the documents in the order listed (PRIMARY first, then IMPORTANT, then others).

### 3. Keep Documents Updated

As your project evolves, update AI Bootstrap documentation. Spec-Kit commands will then reference the latest patterns and standards.

### 4. Use Document References in Prompts

When running Spec-Kit commands, explicitly tell your AI assistant which documents to read:

```
/speckit.plan

Before creating the plan, please read:
- docs/architecture.md
- specs/configuration.md
- docs/api.md (if backend)

Then create the implementation plan following the patterns in these documents.
```

### 5. Validate Against Documentation

After each Spec-Kit command, validate that the output aligns with your AI Bootstrap documentation:
- Constitution should align with `ai-instructions.md` and `docs/code-standards.md`
- Spec should align with `project-brief.md`
- Plan should follow `docs/architecture.md`
- Tasks should respect existing patterns
- Implementation should follow all technical documentation

|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `/speckit.constitution` | `ai-instructions.md` | `docs/code-standards.md` (if available) |
| `/speckit.specify` | `project-brief.md` | `docs/business-flows.md` (backend), `docs/app-store.md` (mobile) |
| `/speckit.plan` | `docs/architecture.md`, `specs/configuration.md` | `specs/security.md` (backend), `docs/navigation.md` (mobile), `docs/components.md` (frontend) |
| `/speckit.tasks` | `docs/api.md` (backend), `docs/data-model.md` (backend), `docs/state-management.md` (frontend/mobile), `docs/styling.md` (frontend), `docs/permissions.md` (mobile) | `docs/testing.md` |

## Troubleshooting

### "Document not found" Errors

If a referenced document doesn't exist:
- Check that you've completed the `/bootstrap` process
- Verify the document exists in your project root or `docs/` directory
- For fullstack projects, some documents may be backend-only or frontend-only

### "Patterns don't match" Issues

If Spec-Kit output doesn't match your project patterns:
- Ensure you've explicitly referenced the relevant documents in your prompt
- Verify your AI Bootstrap documentation is up to date
- Re-run `/docs-update` to sync documentation with code changes

### Integration with Existing Spec-Kit Projects

If you're adding AI Bootstrap to an existing Spec-Kit project:
1. Run `ai-bootstrap init .` to generate documentation
2. Update `memory/constitution.md` to reference `ai-instructions.md`
3. Use this guide to map Spec-Kit commands to AI Bootstrap documents
